# Evan-Sphere Journal Backend
The backend for an unreleased website I am working on. It is going to be a website where you journal about your day. You will have a streak similar to doulingo.

## Install/Run Evan-SphereJournalBackend

Make sure you have git installed, and run 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aprettygoodprogramer/evan-sphereJournalBackend.git
cd evan-sphereJournalBackend
```
Then install cargo, to build the project.

Then simply run
```bash
cargo run
```
